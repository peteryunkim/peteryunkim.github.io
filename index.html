								<h3>Brief backgound</h3>
								<p> My name is Peter Kim and I'm a licensed pharmacist in the state of New York. I am a product of Chicago and moved to New York in 2015. I worked as a pharmacist for a year and a half and while I enjoyed it, I felt that there was something else I wanted to pursue. Now I'm obsessed with programming.</p>
								<p> Ever since I was young, I've always had a curious nature and took apart many things to figure out how it works. I've destroyed so many products and fixed... most of it back up. One thing that intrigued me the most is technology, specifically, the internet and websites. This has always been a lingering curiosity and I finally decided to explore it full-time.</p>
								<h3>Pharmacy</h3>
								<p> I graduated from University of Illinois at Chicago with a Pharm.D in 2015. In my first year as a pharmacist, I quickly learned to adapt and manage stress. At my location, there was no pharmacy technician and no other pharmacists present so I had to manage all the duties and tasks in my 13 hour shifts by myself. Balancing customer service, communicating with other health professionals, and filling prescriptions simultaneously was a challenge that I had to quickly adapt to. My customers and I have a great relationship as I believe a good community is important. Although I enjoyed working as a pharmacist, I craved something more. </p>
								<h3>Tech</h3>
								<p> I decided to do a career change into the tech world and applied to Flatiron School and was accepted. During the program, I was challenged with learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. We had to do projects implementing all of these languages and you can see some demonstrations in the projects portion. I've loved learning all this and continue to obsess with learning more.</p>
